# Petri
Connecting Columbia undergraduates with research opportunities.

## Demo
Check out the prototype linked on the side!
Note: The prototype is only a user interface prototype with no functionality. Furthermore, this is only the design prototype for the student portal. Professors, researchers, and other research posters will have access to another portal (to be designed soon). 

## What is Petri?
Petri can be summarized as something akin to a job board for research labs. Currently, the main problem that students face when looking for research opportunities is the act of discovering them. Often they are unsure which labs are willing to take on undergraduates, and which have space to do so. As such, by creating this “job board” for research experiences, Petri hopes to centralize the research opportunity finding process and simplify it for all students. 

Unlike a job board, students do not "apply" to opportunities. Intead, the listed opportunities will have a contact form that helps students get in contact (through email) with the poster of the research opportunity. This way, not only can students connect with professors and labs to find opportunities as undergraduate researchers, but users can also connect with postdoctoral researchers and graduate students who have posted research tasks that students might be interested in working on. Furthermore, the contact feature greatly reduces the need to check Petri's website for inquiries as inquiries will be received directly through email.

## Who will Petri help?
Undergraduate students entering Columbia are led to believe that finding research opportunities are easy and plentiful. However, there is no job posting page or research opportunity list that they can easily access to search through these opportunities. On top of this, labs often seem inaccessible to undergraduates specifically, and students believe professors do not want or need undergraduate help. As such, Petri hopes to help undergraduate students, especially newer students, who are looking for research opportunities and research experience at Columbia.

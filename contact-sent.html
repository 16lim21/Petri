                            Petri is a tool that connect undergraduate students to research 
                            opportunities throughout the Columbia University campus. We aggregate 
                            all research opportunities across multiple university departments to 
                            give students easy access to these opportunities.

                        <div class="question-title">How do I use Petri?</div>
                        <div class="question-answer">
                            First make sure to look through your class schedule and see if you have
                            time to participate in reserach work throughout the semester. Many 
                            research opportunities expect students to commit to an agreed upon 
                            set of hours each week so don’t agree to commit to something you don’t 
                            have time for! <br/><br/>

                            Then, look through all the opportunities posted on Petri. Use our search 
                            and filter features to narrow down the experiences to only those that 
                            interest you. Don’t forget to read through the descriptions for each 
                            opportunity to get a better understanding of what you would be doing.<br/><br/>

                            Once you have identified a few suitable opportunities, click on the 
                            opportunity’s “contact” button to send the researchers an email through 
                            our website. Make sure to include any information they listed in the 
                            “What we want to know about you” section. Once an inqury is submitted, 
                            researchers will respond directly to your email.

                            The biology department has written a great guide to finding research 
                            opportunities at Columbia. It includes other information such as how to 
                            structure your emails or information on researching for credit. Make sure
